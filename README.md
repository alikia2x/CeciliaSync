# CeciliaSync

CeciliaSync is a sync tool designed for your **code**.

It features a simple and powerful WebUI, as well as an API-based command line interface.

It supports **Git**, so unlike OneDrive or Dropbox, it automatically syncs your code with respect to your `.gitignore`.

## Installation

Clone this repository and run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies.

Run `pnpm build` to build the project, then `pnpm go` to start the server.
